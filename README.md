## About The Project

This is a front-end project developed with the React framework, which consumes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to display a list of popular movies, their details, and allows users to manage a favorites list. The project was built with a focus on development best practices, responsiveness, and user experience.

## Features

*   **Popular Movies Listing:** Displays a paginated list of the most popular movies.
*   **Movie Details:** By clicking on a movie, the user can view detailed information such as synopsis, budget, original language, popularity, release date, and genres.
*   **Favorites System:** Allows adding and removing movies from a favorites list, using Redux for state management.
*   **Advanced Pagination:** Navigation between movie pages with arrow buttons and a numerical page list.
*   **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to different screen sizes, using Bootstrap.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Performance optimization to load page components only when necessary.
